# TodoMVC - Vanilla

This version is written with the most pure code, it uses `Proxy` with `set` and `deleteProperty` handlers. All the CSS has been rewrite to fit with the same quality of the JS code.

`./build.sh dev` build [the development version](https://mr21.github.io/todomvc-vanilla/index-dev.html)  
`./build.sh prod` build [the production version](https://mr21.github.io/todomvc-vanilla/)

Only the production version works offline.

The entire production version weighs **5KB**, and 25% of this is the favicon.  
I didn't recode my own framework and the code is still perfectly maintenable.
